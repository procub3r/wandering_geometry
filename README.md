# wandering_geometry
I made this super quick in like half an hour 'cause I couldn't sleep. I've always wanted to make a similar effect, but looking at Hack The Box's home page - https://www.hackthebox.eu/ - inspired me to finally make it.
Update: The site has updated and no longer features the effect it used to. You can take a look at the effect in the screenshots folder of this repo though!
